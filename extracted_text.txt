IMF Executive Board Concludes the 2024 Article IV 
Consultation with Qatar  
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
Washington, DC – February 11, 2025: On January 27, 2025, the Executive Board of the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation 1 with Qatar. 
Growth normalization after the 2022 FIFA World Cup continued, with signs of strengthening 
activities more recently. Real GDP growth is projected to improve gradually to 2 percent in 
2024–25 supported by public investment, spillovers from the ongoing LNG expansion project, 
and strong tourism. Medium-term growth is expected to accelerate to 4¾ percent on average, 
boosted by the significant LNG production expansion and initial gains from implementing 
reforms guided by the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3). Headline inflation will 
likely ease to 1 percent in 2024 and converge to around 2 percent over the medium term.  
With lower hydrocarbon prices, both the current account and fiscal surpluses narrowed in 
2023, to 17 percent of GDP and 5½ percent of GDP, respectively. The twin surpluses 
moderated further in 2024. Over the medium, as Qatar’s LNG production expands massively, 
both the current and fiscal accounts will likely remain in surpluses, albeit declining as a share 
of GDP, as hydrocarbon prices are projected to fall. 
Banks are well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable, with the capital adequacy ratio of close to 
20 percent and return on equity of 14½ percent, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024. 
Since the implementation of QCB measures to reduce banks’ net short-term foreign liabilities, 
banks’ non-resident deposits declined significantly, and banks have lengthened the average 
maturity and diversified further the sources of foreign funding. The sector-wide NPL ratio 
remained broadly unchanged at slightly below 4 percent and the provisioning coverage ratio is 
relatively high at above 80 percent.     
Qatar has started to implement the ambitious Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) to 
build a more diversified, knowledge-based and private sector-driven economy. Guided by 
NDS3, reform momentum has strengthened significantly, including to attract and retain high-
skilled expatriate workers, foster innovation, promote public-private partnerships, and further 
improve the business efficiency. Qatar is well positioned to leverage digitalization and AI for 
productivity gains, and the nation’s climate agenda is advancing.  
Risks to the outlook are broadly balanced. Main downside risks stem from the global 
headwinds, including a sharper-than-expected global growth slowdown, increased volatility in 
global financial conditions and commodity prices, and further worsening of geopolitical 
tensions. The regional conflict has had limited impact on Qatar but adds further to the 
downside risks through lower tourism and capital inflows, and more volatile hydrocarbon

prices. Domestic downside risk stems mainly from further weaknesses in the real estate 
sector, although strong tourism and policy measures introduced in 2023 could mitigate the 
risk. Over the medium and long term, supply in the global natural gas market is expected to 
expand significantly, potentially putting downward pressure on prices. On the upside, 
sustained high hydrocarbon prices and accelerated NDS3 reforms would strengthen the 
outlook. However, if ambitious NDS3 initiatives lead to resource misallocation, both the public 
finance and growth prospect would be affected. 
Executive Board Assessment2 
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They welcomed Qatar’s 
continued resilience to external shocks and its favorable medium-term outlook, driven by 
significant increases in LNG production and the reforms under the Third National 
Development Strategy. Directors agreed that maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies and 
accelerating reform efforts would further solidify macroeconomic stability and resilience to 
shocks while boosting prosperity. 
Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to continued fiscal prudence and called for 
accelerating fiscal reforms. They recommended adopting a medium-term fiscal anchor to help 
ensure intergenerational equity, and reiterated the need to accelerate revenue diversification, 
particularly by introducing the value-added tax. Directors highlighted the importance of 
improving spending efficiency and composition, particularly by enhancing public investment 
management. They welcomed the ongoing efforts to strengthen fiscal institutions and adopt a 
full-fledged medium-term fiscal framework with enhanced fiscal risk management.  
Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to maintain financial stability and deepen domestic 
financial markets, while encouraging them to consider undertaking a Financial Sector 
Assessment Program update. They welcomed the newly introduced risk-based supervision 
and recommended formalizing the financial safety net and continuing to adjust 
macroprudential policies to mitigate potential macro-financial risks. Directors encouraged the 
authorities to sustain their progress in fighting financial crimes.  
Directors agreed that the exchange rate peg continues to serve Qatar well. They concurred 
that, as conditions allow, strengthening the operational framework would further enhance 
monetary policy transmission.  
Directors supported the authorities’ strategy to build a more diversified, private sector-led, and 
knowledge-based economy. They recommended fostering innovation and business efficiency 
and enhancing human capital by attracting and retaining more high-skilled expatriate workers, 
improving Qatari nationals’ employment in the private sector, and further increasing female 
labor force participation. Directors agreed that aligning domestic energy prices with export 
prices would benefit public finances and support climate goals. They also encouraged the 
authorities to close remaining data gaps, with the help of IMF capacity development. 
2 At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chair of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and 
this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing up can be found h ere:

QATAR 
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2024 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION 
 
KEY ISSUES 
Context: Growth normalization after the 2022 FIFA World Cup continued with signs of 
activities strengthening more recently. Fiscal and external surpluses softened mainly due to 
lower hydrocarbon prices. Banks are healthy but pockets of vulnerabilities remain. Reform 
momentum has strengthened, guided by the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3). 
Outlook and risks: Near-term growth is expected to strengthen gradually. The medium-
term outlook is more favorable, bolstered by massive LNG production expansion and 
reform gains. Fiscal and external surpluses will likely remain but moderate. Qatar has so far 
been resilient to the regional conflict, with risks to the outlook being balanced overall. 
Qatar’s strong policy buffers can help mitigate the impact of adverse shocks. 
Fiscal policy: The authorities’ commitment to continued fiscal prudence is welcome. The 
positive outlook provides an opportunity to accelerate revenue diversification including to 
introduce a value-added tax and broaden the corporate income tax, enhance spending 
efficiency and gradually align domestic energy prices with export prices, and reorient 
spending to enable private sector-driven growth. Adopting a full-fledged medium-term 
fiscal framework, anchored by the benchmark to ensure intergenerational equity, will 
enhance fiscal sustainability while securing priority spending. Greater fiscal transparency 
and risk management, including on Public-Private Partnerships, will support the strategy.  
Monetary and financial sector policies: The currency peg continues to serve the country 
well. Efforts to strengthen liquidity management are welcome and should be guided by the 
recent IMF technical assistance. Continued diligence to safeguard financial stability and 
formalizing the financial safety net are critical. Promoting more stable domestic funding 
through market deepening initiatives would help reduce banks’ exposure to short-term 
foreign funding. Strong efforts to improve AML/CFT effectiveness should continue. 
Structural reforms: Successful NDS3 implementation requires proper reform prioritization 
and inter-agency coordination. Priorities include to enhance human capital and innovation, 
promote trade diversification and FDI (with domestic knowledge spillovers) and further 
improve business efficiency, especially access to finance. Qatar is well positioned to 
leverage digitalization and AI for productivity gains. Accelerating climate actions can 
strengthen sustainability and generate “green” growth. Policies targeting specific sectors or 
economic zones should be managed carefully. Statistics should continue to improve.

CONTEXT 
1.      Qatar has started the implementation of the much anticipated Third National 
Development Strategy (NDS3) to chart a new course for economic transformation (Text 
Figure 1). Driven by significant public infrastructure investment over the last decade, Qatar’s non-
hydrocarbon economy has grown to account for about two-thirds of the total output. Diversification 
in fiscal revenue and exports, however, has progressed more slowly. The trend decline in total factor 
productivity has also been a drag to economic growth. Acknowledging these challenges, NDS3 
(launched in January 2024) calls for a decisive transition from the costly state-driven growth model 
to a private sector-led one, with the state becoming an enabler. NDS3 is reform-focused, aiming to 
build a more sustainable and knowledge-based economy, with ambitious targets set and 
“diversification clusters” identified to build comparative advantages (Annex I). Reform momentum 
has strengthened significantly since the launch of NDS3.  
 Text Figure 1. Qatar’s Diversification Progress and Challenges 
Qatar has made limited progress in economic 
diversification. 
 While Qatar’s infrastructure quality has improved 
significantly… 
  
 
 
…its productivity growth has been subdued.  The state-driven growth model proves costly—more 
durable growth should come from the private sector.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 
2.      Growth normalization after the 2022 FIFA World Cup continued with signs of a gradual 
rebound more recently (Figure 1 and Text Figure 2). Real GDP growth declined from 4.2 percent in 
2022 (where World Cup-related activities lifted non-hydrocarbon growth to 5.7 percent) to 
1.2 percent in 2023 (with non-hydrocarbon growth at 1.1 percent as construction activities contracted 
and services growth moderated). Tourism rose significantly since the World Cup, with visitor arrivals 
rising 60 percent from 2022 to 2023. Real GDP growth strengthened gradually to an average of 
1.4 percent (year on year) in the first three quarters of 2024, supported by non-hydrocarbon growth 
of 2.9 percent. The peak tourist arrivals during the 2024 soccer Asian Cup (January–February) 
exceeded those during the World Cup. The population continued to rise and employment reached a 
record high. Recent PMI readings were mostly in the expansionary territory—with new orders and 
employment particularly strong—benefitting from public investment and the ongoing North Field 
LNG expansion project. The non-hydrocarbon output gap is estimated to be close to zero.

3.      Inflation continued to moderate amid the growth normalization and tighter monetary 
policy (Figure 2 and Text Figure 3). Headline inflation declined from 5 percent in 2022 to 3.0 percent 
in 2023 (period average). It decelerated further to 1.2 percent in 2024 through October as rent and 
recreation services inflation weakened. Producer price and wage inflation remained contained.

Headline inflation fell as housing and recreation service 
components weakened… 
…while producer price and real wage inflation rates 
remain contained.  
   
Sources: Haver and IMF staff calculations. 
4.      Domestic financial conditions tightened, while monetary policy easing started in 
September 2024 (Figure 2 and Text Figure 4). The QCB continued to follow the US Federal Reserve 
in setting policy rates and improved liquidity management through calibrated T-bill issuance. As 
hydrocarbon prices moderated, the associated liquidity to the banking sector decreased. Bank 
lending to domestic private sector eased to 5 percent (year-on-year) in 2023 while credit to the 
public sector contracted after major World Cup-related infrastructure projects were completed. 
Domestic credit accelerated in 2024 so far as private credit to services and trade strengthened, and 
positive public credit growth resumed to support investment projects. Credit to the real estate 
sector contracted (year-on-year) earlier in 2024 but grew from August.  
5.      The current account surplus narrowed mainly on lower hydrocarbon prices (Figure 3 
and Text Figure 5). The current account surplus shrank from 27 percent of GDP in 2022 to a still 
sizeable 17 percent of GDP in 2023. The trade surplus moderated further in 2024 as hydrocarbon 
export continued to decline. On the other hand, tourism and transportation services were buoyant, 
and remittance outflows remained stable despite a rise in expatriate employment. The QCB’s 
international reserves rose gradually to US$53.8 billion in November 2024, strengthening the reserve 
coverage (projected to reach 62 percent of the ARA metric by end 2024). This is complemented by 
the sizeable foreign assets held by Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), estimated to have exceeded 
200 percent of GDP in 2023, through which a significant share of the hydrocarbon windfalls is 
invested abroad. The external position is assessed to be moderately stronger than the level 
suggested by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies (Annex II).

points (ppts) of GDP from 2022 (1½ ppts of GDP above budgeted). The 2023 non-hydrocarbon 
primary balance (NHPB) thus worsened by 1½ ppts of non-hydrocarbon GDP from 2022, 
representing a moderate fiscal loosening. The central government debt remained largely unchanged 
in percent of GDP (43 percent at end-2023).  
7.      The banking sector remains healthy (Figure 5 and Text Figure 6). Banks are well-
capitalized (with the Capital Adequacy Ratio of close to 20 percent in 2024Q3) and liquid, with 
robust net interest margin (NIM) as higher funding costs were mostly passed on to borrowers. 
Banks’ non-interest income also increased, supporting profitability. The sector-wide NPL ratio 
remained broadly unchanged at 3.9 percent in 2024Q3, but bank-level NPLs varied considerably, 
tilted to the weaker side. On the other hand, NPLs are relatively well provisioned, by more than 
80 percent. Actions have also been taken to address relatively high NPLs in some banks, 
including through restructuring. Since the implementation of QCB measures to reduce banks’ 
net exposure to short-term foreign liabilities,1 banks’ non-resident deposits declined 
significantly in 2022 before stabilizing (as a share of total liabilities) since 2023, and other 
foreign liabilities fell only modestly. Banks’ foreign liabilities thus remained elevated, but with 
lengthened average maturity and more diversified external funding sources.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS 
8.       Growth is expected to strengthen gradually in the near term and pick up more 
forcefully over the medium term. Real GDP growth is projected to improve to 2 percent in 2024–
25, in line with staff’s nowcasting estimates 
(Text Figure 7 and Annex III), as non-
hydrocarbon growth gradually increases, 
supported by public investment, spillovers 
from the ongoing LNG expansion project, and 
strong tourism. Monetary policy easing will 
likely accelerate domestic credit growth and 
bolster broader economic activities. Medium-
term growth is expected to accelerate (to an 
average of around 4¾ percent) on the back 
of massive North Field LNG production 
expansion (a cumulative increase of around 
85 percent by 2030), and initial NDS3 reform 
gains. Headline inflation will likely ease to 
1 percent in 2024, before converging to 
2 percent over the medium term as monetary policy eases and growth strengthens. 
9.      The external and fiscal surpluses will likely remain, albeit declining as a share of GDP. 
Qatar’s LNG production expansion is set to generate significant hydrocarbon revenues and maintain 
the twin surpluses, assuming continued fiscal discipline. The surpluses (in percent of GDP), however, 
are projected to moderate over the medium term as hydrocarbon prices are expected to soften. 
Central government debt is set to gradually decline to around 36 percent of GDP by 2029. Qatar is 
assessed to have a low overall risk of sovereign stress (Annex IV). 
10.      Risks to the outlook are broadly balanced (Annex V). Main external downside risks include 
a sharper-than-expected global growth slowdown, increased volatility in global financial conditions 
and commodity prices, and further worsening of geopolitical tensions. The regional conflict has had 
limited impact on Qatar, but adds further to the downside risks with potential impact through lower 
tourism and capital inflows, and more volatile hydrocarbon prices. Domestic downside risk stems 
mainly from further weaknesses in the real estate sector, while the risk could be mitigated by the 
proper implementation of the measures introduced in 2023 to enhance transparency and regulation 
of real estate activities
2 as well as strong tourism. Over the medium and long term, the expected 
significant expansion of global natural gas supply could exert downward price pressures, although 
Qatar’s low production cost and proven reliability could mitigate the impact (Text Figure 8).3 Other 
key downside risks include worsening climate stressors and a disorderly global energy transition. On 
 
2 In 2023, the law regulating the real estate sector was updated, the Real Estate Regulatory Authority was established 
to strengthen regulation, and macroprudential measures were refined to enhance risk control of bank lending to the 
real estate sector. See Box I. “State of the Real Estate Sector in Qatar” in the 2023 Staff Report for Qatar.

the upside, sustained high hydrocarbon prices and accelerated NDS3 reforms would strengthen the 
outlook. However, if ambitious NDS3 initiatives lead to resource misallocation, both the public 
finance and growth prospect would be affected.

Authorities’ Views 
11.      The authorities broadly concurred with staff’s assessment of the economic outlook 
and risks. They highlighted the significant boost to growth from the NF LNG expansion and 
intensifying reform efforts to meet ambitious NDS3 targets. They noted that the regional conflict 
had no visible impact on Qatar, including on LNG shipment. The authorities highlighted that strong 
tourism and reforms related to permanent residency through real estate investments would provide 
further boost to the real estate sector, and the policy measures to regulate real estate activities 
introduced last year would help mitigate potential risks. Overall, the authorities reiterated that 
Qatar’s strong fundamentals and policy buffers would help dampen any negative impact if downside 
risks materialize. 
 
POLICIES TO PURSUE TRANSFORMATION AMID

12.      Policy discussions focused on maintaining stability against the global headwinds and 
accelerating reforms. Building on the progress in implementing past recommendations (Annex VI), 
policy discussions focused on: (i) sustaining fiscal discipline and accelerating revenue, expenditure 
and fiscal institutional reforms; (ii) safeguarding financial sector stability and deepening financial 
markets; (iii) further enhancing the effectiveness of the monetary policy operational framework; and 
(iv) intensifying structural reforms guided by NDS3.

A.   Fiscal Policy: Enhance Resilience and Support Diversification  
13.       The authorities plan to resume gradual fiscal consolidation from 2024. Despite a 
moderate fiscal loosening in 2023 amid slower growth, the NHPB is estimated to remain consistent 
with the level suggested by the Permanent 
Income Hypothesis (PIH), a benchmark to 
ensure intergenerational equity (Text 
Figure 9). 4 The 2024 budget envisages 
spending cuts worth 2 ppts of GDP from 
the 2023 outturn, mostly in capital 
expenditure, while the fiscal outturn up to 
the third quarter of 2024 suggests that the 
overall expenditure cuts could be milder 
than budgeted, closer to 1½ ppts pf GDP. 
Nonetheless, the fiscal stance is still likely 
to tighten, with the NHPB projected to 
improve by around ¾ ppt of non-
hydrocarbon GDP. The 2025 budget 
envisages broadly prudent spending plans 
amid the growth rebound. The medium-
term budget has been updated to reflect 
NDS3 spending needs, where continued 
gradual consolidation is expected.  
14.      Staff welcomed the authorities’ 
commitment to continued fiscal 
prudence and recommended adopting a 
fiscal anchor to support the strategy. 
The PIH-based benchmark can serve as a 
medium-term fiscal anchor to ensure intergenerational equity. Higher-than-expected hydrocarbon 
revenues should be saved to strengthen fiscal buffers. During economic downturns, some fiscal 
space could be deployed to provide targeted support, while a credible plan should be in place to 
guide the NHPB to return to the PIH-based fiscal anchor (with a view to eventually introducing a 
fiscal rule).
5 The assessment of fiscal stance would be more accurate if expenditures by government 
related entities (GREs) are also accounted for. The PIH-based fiscal anchor should be updated 
periodically as the global energy transition unfolds to ensure realistic long-term oil price 
assumptions. 
15.      Revenue diversification should accelerate to enhance resilience and modernize the tax 
system. The highly uncertain global energy transition is now compounded by rising geopolitical

tensions, potentially exacerbating Qatar’s 
hydrocarbon revenue volatility (from both prices 
and export volume). To strengthen resilience and 
reduce Qatar’s potential tax revenue gap, non-
hydrocarbon revenue diversification should 
accelerate, taking advantage of Qatar’s favorable 
medium-term outlook (Text Figure 10).6 Priorities 
include to:   
• Introduce the value-added tax (VAT). The 
tax authority has readied the infrastructure 
for VAT introduction and staff reiterated that 
the authorities accelerate the introduction of 
a broad-based VAT with a starting rate in line 
with the GCC treaty. The VAT implementation 
would not only bring in additional revenue 
(up to 1½ percent of GDP with a VAT rate of 
5 percent), but also help gather 
comprehensive information, facilitating other 
tax introduction and administration. The 
initial growth and inflation impact of VAT 
introduction is estimated to be transitory and 
small.7 The negative growth impact could be 
further mitigated by using the VAT revenue 
productively. Allowing businesses sufficient 
time to prepare (e.g., 12 months) is also 
crucial for a smooth rollout. 
• Broaden the corporate income tax (CIT). 
Along with other GCC countries, Qatar is 
committed to adopt the global minimum CIT 
on multinationals (foreign companies are 
already subject to 10 percent of CIT in Qatar). 
It is encouraging that Qatar is aiming to start 
the implementation from the beginning of 
2025, consistent with the global timetable. 
The implementation should proceed in line 
with global trends to avoid revenue losses 
and minimize the compliance burden on 
businesses. Introducing a CIT for domestic 
firms (with appropriate thresholds) could also

be considered over the medium term to further broaden the tax base and allow a level playing 
field between domestic and foreign firms.   
16.      Gradually aligning Qatar’s domestic energy prices with its corresponding export prices 
could increase revenue, generate savings, and support Qatar’s climate goals. Thanks to 
previous subsidy reforms, domestic energy price differentials from international ones are lower in 
Qatar than in its regional and emerging market (EM) peers (Text Figure 11). To further reduce the 
price differentials, the caps on diesel and gasoline prices should be lifted and remaining electricity 
subsidies gradually phased out. The natural gas price differential (IEA, 2022) partially reflects the 
supply-demand dynamics in domestic and international markets. 8 The first step is to improve 
transparency of domestic gas pricing to better understand its disparity with Qatar’s export prices. 
Liquefication and export facilities could be expanded alongside the North Field LNG expansion to 
allow export of extra domestic gas supply to generate additional revenue and support Qatar’s 
climate initiatives to ensure efficient natural gas use domestically. Gradually aligning domestic 
natural gas prices with export ones would also incentivize the private sector to build comparative 
advantages beyond low energy cost, fostering diversification that is not reliant on the hydrocarbon 
sector. 
17.      Spending efficiency and composition should continue to improve to strengthen fiscal 
sustainability and support NDS3 reforms, including to: 
• Continue to contain the wage bill. Qatar has a smaller wage bill (in percent of GDP) than 
regional peers, reflecting continued efforts to improve public wage bill efficiency (Text 
Figure 12). Looking ahead, with more national graduates looking for public sector jobs and 
potentially new government 
services to support reforms, 
the wage bill could be 
pressured. Rationalization 
measures include to further 
promote government 
efficiency including through 
greater digitalization, closely 
link the increase in headcount 
to the efficient provision of 
new public services, incentivize 
the Qataris to seek private 
sector jobs, tighten the 
eligibility for benefits, and 
reduce staffing by natural 
attrition.   
 
8 For example, potential extra supply of natural gas domestically cannot be easily liquefied and exported due to 
capacity limits in liquefication and export, resulting in lower (than export) domestic natural gas prices.

• Reorient public spending toward higher returns. Qatar’s fiscal multipliers over the last three 
decades are estimated to be stronger than those in other GCC countries, especially for capital 
expenditure. However, multipliers have fallen as the investment cycle from the World Cup 
matured, suggesting more limited returns from future public infrastructure investment (Box I). 
Meanwhile, investment to build a knowledge-based economy, including to leverage Qatar’s 
advanced digital access and readiness to embrace artificial intelligence (AI) (see Section D), and 
enhance climate resilience and sustainability, could generate high returns, not only in terms of 
direct growth gains, but also in creating an enabling environment for the private sector.9  Any 
public sector-driven initiatives to promote private sector development should avoid supporting 
unviable firms. Meanwhile, as Qatar undertakes necessary fiscal reforms, such as introducing the 
VAT and gradually phasing out subsidies, targeted transfers to vulnerable households are 
important to strengthen social protection.   
• Strengthen public investment management. IMF estimates suggest that the most efficient 
public investors can achieve twice the growth impact from their investment than the least 
efficient ones.10 Staff’s past analysis suggests room to further improve Qatar’s public investment 
efficiency. As new investment will be undertaken to support NDS3, the authorities could benefit 
from the IMF’s Public Investment Management Assessment (PIMA) and/or Climate-PIMA.  
Box 1. Estimating Fiscal Multipliers in Qatar and the GCC 
This box estimates fiscal multipliers in Qatar and its GCC peers over the past three decades.1 This 
analysis examines fiscal multipliers, defined as the non-hydrocarbon growth gains from government 
spending, from different expenditures over time, with a special attention to the level of capital stock to 
capture the potential negative impact of excessive use of seemingly productive expenditures (Devarajan et 
al., 1996). Our empirical strategy broadly follows Espinoza et al. (2011) and Fouejieu et al (2018) with both a 
GCC panel estimate (and teasing out Qatar-specific effects) and a single-country time-series analysis for 
Qatar. 
Generally, Qatar had stronger fiscal multipliers than its GCC peers, but the gains from capital 
expenditure weakened when capital stock became relatively high. Results from cross-GCC panel 
regression suggest that for the GCC, the average long-run fiscal multiplier for capital expenditure (0.7) is 
stronger and more persistent than that for current expenditure (statistically insignificant), although the 
growth gains from the former emerge with a lag. The Qatar-specific long-term cumulative multiplier for 
capital expenditure (based on the GCC panel regression and a country dummy for Qatar) is close to 1.5. 
When capital stock is relatively high, however, the capital spending multipliers for both Qatar and the GCC 
become insignificant. 
A further analysis confirms how growth gains from capital spending in Qatar waned when the 
infrastructure investment cycle appeared to have matured (Box Figure 1-1). Using a single-county 
approach, time-varying fiscal multipliers from capital spending in Qatar are estimated on a 12-year rolling 
basis. Results suggest that World Cup-related capital spending in the 2010s had stronger (first panel) and 
more persistent (second panel) growth impact than previous public investment. These may reflect a more 
comprehensive infrastructure investment strategy and/or higher spending efficiency.
2 However, as the 
infrastructure investment cycle started to mature, the growth effects moderated.

1 This box summarizes key findings of the Selected Issues Paper “Estimating Fiscal Multiplier for Qatar.” 
2  These interpretations are suggestive, as the model does not control for other potential determinants and the rolling 
approach further reduces the sample size. 
18.      Welcome efforts to strengthen fiscal institutions pave the way to adopt a full-fledged 
medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) with enhanced fiscal risk management:  
• MTFF with strengthened budget execution and risk assessment. The extension of the 
medium-term budget to five years and progress in introducing program-based budgeting are 
encouraging. Staff also welcomed the authorities’ initiative to enhance macroeconomic 
projections to support the medium-term budget update. These efforts pave the way to 
introduce a full-fledged MTFF, anchored by the PIH benchmark, to strengthen fiscal 
sustainability and ensure priority spending. The MTFF should guide and be integrated into the 
annual budget process, with performance-based allocations and strengthened budget execution 
to ensure compliance. The MTFF and annual budget should be complemented by regular fiscal 
risk assessments, including those stemming from Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs, see below), 
and underpinned by enhanced fiscal transparency. IMF technical assistance (TA) on the MTFF 
can support the authorities’ efforts.   
• Managing fiscal risks from PPPs. Around QAR10 billion (US$2¾ billion) of PPP projects are in the 
pipeline, focusing on health, education, hospitality, and infrastructure. It is critical to manage 
potential fiscal risks (including contingent liabilities) by adopting an appropriate risk-sharing and 
monitoring framework, underpinned by transparency and strong governance. PPPs should be fully 
integrated into the state budget and the MTFF.

• Establishing a sovereign asset-liability management framework encompassing the general
government, including the QIA and GREs, would help coordinate investments for economic
transformation and enhance asset-liability management.
Authorities’ Views 
19. The authorities reiterated their commitment to fiscal discipline and broadly shared
staff’s views on the fiscal strategy. They highlighted that funding allocations for NDS3 initiatives
were prudent with an emphasis on public spending efficiency. To this end, the authorities noted
good progress in expanding program-based budgeting to eventually cover all sectors by 2025, and
e
xpected that the ongoing expenditure review would generate savings in the medium term. The
authorities also expressed initial interest in exploring a PIH-based fiscal anchor. They saw fiscal risks
f
rom ongoing PPPs, mainly on operating and maintaining existing infrastructure, to be small. The
authorities stressed that no subsidies on natural gas were provided, but expressed willingness in
exploring ways to increase the transparency of domestic natural gas price setting. They emphasized
t
hat access to reliable energy sources would play a critical role in attracting FDI and promoting
economic diversification more broadly. The authorities agreed on the need to diversify revenues and
c
ommitted to implement the CIT Pillar II in line with the global timetable (the Cabinet recently
approved a draft law amending some provisions of the Income Tax Law and referred it to the Shura
C
ouncil). They continued to assess the appropriate timing for VAT introduction. Under the overall
objective of gradually reducing government debt, the authorities’ debt management strategy takes
into account the need for green financing and for supporting domestic financial market deepening,
in coordination with the QCB.
B. Financial Sector Policy: Maintain Stability and Deepen Markets
20. Vigilant QCB policies have helped secure financial stability, while pockets of
vulnerabilities warrant continued diligence (Figure 5). The banking sector remains healthy despite
the growth normalization and tighter financial conditions, thanks to robust buffers, diligent QCB
policies and ample hydrocarbon liquidity. Recent QCB measures to reduce banks’ short-term foreign
a
sset-liability mismatches and risks in their exposure to a weaker real estate market are welcome,
e
specially as easing global financial conditions could stimulate foreign funding by banks and real
estate companies. The QCB should make more granular data (e.g., the average maturity structure of
banking sector foreign assets and liabilities, NPLs by sector) available to enhance monitoring and
f
acilitate risk assessment. The NPL ratio will likely remain contained as economic activity picks up
and credit demand strengthens. In this context, continued diligence in supervision is important
especially for banks with weaker asset qualities. Qatar Development Bank (QDB) initiatives to
support SMEs should be limited to viable but liquidity-constrained firms. Further increase in the
already high sovereign-bank nexus calls for attention. Some banks have partly replaced their foreign
f
unding with public sector deposits, but access to such deposits is reportedly uneven, with smaller
banks facing higher funding costs (Text Figure 13). The availability of public sector deposits could
also be affected by hydrocarbon revenue volatility. To this end, the ongoing initiatives to deepen the
domestic capital market would help banks diversify their funding sources. On the asset side, sizeable
=== PAGE 21 ===

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17 
bank holdings of public sector assets in gross terms (around 30 percent of total assets11) could 
crowd out credit to the private sector, slowing the transition to private sector-led growth.   
21. The QCB should continue to enhance banking sector resilience and formalize the
financial safety net. Welcome QCB initiatives to improve risk-based supervision, establish a deposit
insurance scheme and formalize the recovery and resolution frameworks are supported by IMF TAs.
The
 authorities (including the QCB, MOF and QIA) have traditionally lent strong support to banks
during market turbulences and formalizing crisis management frameworks would further enhance
predictability, efficiency and confidence. The QCB should continue to review its macroprudential
policies and adjust as needed to mitigate potential macro-financial risks, which tend to build up
amid easing financial conditions. Building on the QCB's progress in strengthening financial stability,
staff continued to recommend that Qatar undertake an FSAP update (last FSAP was concluded in
2007).

lending to the public sector was broadly stable.

22. The Third Financial Sector Strategy (FSS3) puts a welcome emphasis on domestic
financial markets deepening—timely and well-coordinated implementation is essential. The
Strategy, launched in November 2023, seeks to promote savings, offer borrowing and investment
o
pportunities, develop the insurance sector, foster fintech, and achieve greater financial inclusion.
Many initiatives have been introduced, including to lend greater support to SMEs, accelerate digital
transformation, and expand financial service offering including advisory. Regulatory sandboxes have
been expanded to accelerate fintech innovation and the Qatar Financial Center’s digital asset
framework has established the legal and regulatory foundation for digital assets. The QCB is also
exploring the concept of a wholesale CBDC and has requested IMF TA. Work is ongoing to promote
greater awareness and penetration of insurance products to enhance resilience to shocks. Setting up

of primary dealers and a derivatives exchange will facilitate capital market deepening. Initiatives to 
foster more stable domestic funding would complement the QCB measures in reducing banks’ 
reliance on short-term foreign funding. To help intensify reform implementation in adherence to 
FSS3, the QCB launched own Strategy 2024–30 in October 2024. Key stakeholders, including 
different regulatory authorities, should coordinate to ensure policy consistency and timely 
implementation.  
23. Qatar has made excellent progress in fighting financial crimes, and strong efforts
should continue. The 2023 AML/CFT mutual evaluation report by FATF acknowledges Qatar’s
s
trength in preventing financial crimes and law enforcement through improved risk assessment
capacity and clearer policy priorities. Measures to reduce risks associated with the use of a large
amount of cash are complemented by efforts to enhance financial inclusion through digitalization.
The QCB has banned financial institutions to use crypto assets. A beneficial ownership registry is
b
eing operationalized. Going forward, Qatar should strengthen risk-based supervision of non-
financial businesses and professions, ensure that the beneficial ownership information is accurate
and easily accessible, and improve further the capacity of AML/CFT law enforcement agencies.
Authorities’ Views 
24. The authorities concurred with staff’s recommendation to continue exercising
vigilance. The QCB highlighted that the newly introduced risk-based supervision strengthened
as
sessment of emerging risks and early action. They believed that banks were well prepared to
manage legacy real estate sector weaknesses and the recent macroprudential measures were
e
ffectively implemented to address potential risks. The QCB also highlighted banks’ progress in
lengthening the average maturity of foreign liabilities including via issuance of medium-term notes,
and its commitment to regular risk reassessment. More broadly, the QCB stressed that both the
micro and macroprudential measures, including the counter-cyclical capital buffer, were periodically
reviewed and would be dynamically adjusted to manage emerging risks. The authorities supported
staff’s call for deepening domestic capital markets, highlighting ongoing efforts in this area as part
o
f the FSS3 implementation, including an initiative with the Ministry of Finance to build the domestic
yield curve.
C. Monetary Policy: Further Enhance Effectiveness of the Operational
Framework
25. The exchange rate peg continues to serve Qatar well. The peg remains a credible
monetary anchor, backed by ample external buffers, continued fiscal prudence and competitiveness-
enhancing reforms. In line with the exchange rate peg, Qatar’s monetary policy is broadly aligned
w
ith that of the U.S. Federal Reserve. More recently, the QCB cut policy interest rates three times,
e
ach time 5 basis points more than the US Federal Reserve did, narrowing the interest rate
differential with the US fed funds rate (Figure 2). Going forward, staff recommended that the QCB
continue to adjust its policy rates in line with the US Federal Reserve. The QCB’s enhanced liquidity
management is welcome and could benefit from stronger coordination with the fiscal authority.
=== PAGE 23 ===
QATAR 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19 
26. Several key actions would further strengthen the effectiveness of the monetary policy
operational framework (Text Figure 14). As recommended by a recent IMF TA, the QCB should
i
mprove analytical capacity for liquidity forecasting and country risk premium assessment as the first
step towards more effective liquidity management and monetary policy implementation. Finalizing
the upgrade to a new real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system towards a more integrated
w
holesale payment system will reduce risks and enhance efficiency in the central bank’s secured
lending operations. Over time, establishing a wider and more stable policy interest rate corridor,
d
eveloping a more active interbank market, and allowing banks to base their lending rates fully on
m
arket conditions by removing the cap on salary-based personal loans would further enhance
monetary policy transmission. Greater central bank communication would also be important to
support these efforts.

Authorities’ Views 
27. The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment on the exchange rate regime and
appreciated IMF TA on liquidity management. They emphasized the ongoing effort to build
c
apacity and planned to progressively implement TA recommendations. The QCB noted that the
recent policy interest rate cuts, slightly more than the US Federal Reserve’s, were motivated by a
relatively wide interest rate differential to the Fed funds rate, domestic macroeconomic conditions
(growth normalization and low inflation), and excess liquidity in the financial system. They
highlighted that the recent policy moves did not have any negative effects including on capital
flows, and future policy decisions would be data driven. The QCB acknowledged the need to further
improve the effectiveness of monetary policy operational framework but saw it as a medium-term
objective. They agreed on the importance of communication and highlighted continued efforts to
enhance it.
D. Structural Reforms: B uild a Knowledge-Based and Sustainable Economy
28. Qatar’s vision to build a diversified, knowledge-based economy requires enhanced
human capital and output complexity (Text Figures 15 and 16). Staff analysis shows that human
c
apital is not only a large, direct contributor to per-capita output, but also an amplifier of the
growth-enhancing impact of higher economic complexity.12 Physical capital has similar, albeit
smaller, effects. When a country has high levels of human and physical capital, the amplification
e
ffect (with economic complexity) on 
output is even stronger. Qatar has 
built a large capital stock with top-
notch infrastructure quality, but its 
labor productivity and economic 
complexity have substantial room to 
improve. Reforms should thus focus 
on: (i) building a highly skilled labor 
force, (ii) promoting innovation and 
knowledge-spillovers (including 
through FDI and trade diversification) 
to boost economic complexity, 
supported by enhanced business 
efficiency, (iii) leveraging Qatar’s 
already advanced digital access and AI 
readiness for further productivity 
gains, and (iv) strengthening climate 
sustainability and generating “green” 
growth.

29. Qatar can build a future-ready labor force by:
• Attracting and retaining high-skilled expatriate workers. Qatar currently has more semi-
skilled expatriate workers than skilled or highly skilled ones (Text Figure 17). Analysis in the I MF’s
2023 Article IV Staff Report for Qatar suggests that increasing the share of more skilled
expatriate workers can be a top contributor to growth. Intensified Kafala reform would further
enhance expatriate labor market protection and flexibility. Speedy implementation of newly
introduced programs targeting higher-skilled expatriate labor (e.g., new visa schemes including
a
 five-year Mustaqel residence visa for foreign talent and entrepreneurs and a visa extension
program for graduating students to find jobs in Qatar) would improve labor force skills.
Strengthening the social safety net including the pension scheme would also help. The renewed
4-year collaboration program with ILO can support the authorities’ progress.
• En hancing the nationals’ talent and employment in the private sector. Qatar’s education
i
nvestment is bearing fruit—more outcome-based education spending could help close the gap
with OECD countries (Text Figure 17). Efforts should also strengthen to incentivize Qatari
nationals to join the private sector, especially the new graduates. A recently launched AI-based
platform to match Qatari graduates with private sector jobs is a welcome initiative. To achieve
the
 NDS3 target of having 20 percent of Qataris employed in the private sector, effective
coordination across public and private sectors, education institutions, and youth associations is
essential to align education with the private sector needs and ensure proper active labor market
policies (e.g., reskilling and upskilling programs) to facilitate the nationals’ employment in the
private sector. As sectoral Qatarization targets are being set and government incentives for
private sector employers to hire Qatari nationals are being contemplated, potential benefits,
including savings on the public sector wage bill, should be balanced against risks, including skill
mismatches. It would be helpful to leverage the ILO’s expertise in setting sectoral Qatarization
targets and active labor market policies.

• Further benefiting from the female talent. Qatari women’s overall access to schooling is on
par with, or exceeds (e.g., in higher education), that of men, but a sizeable gender gap remains
i
n labor force participation rates (IMF’s 2023 Article IV Staff Report for Qatar). E nsuring gender
equality is a key goal in Qatar’s National Vision 2030, and many initiatives have been introduced
t
o empower women and close gender gaps, including in education and the labor market. Recent
efforts include to allow flexible and remote work arrangements, and to lengthen paid maternity
leaves in government agencies. Continued efforts to increase female labor force participation,
e
specially in the private sector, would enhance overall labor force skills and Qatar’s productivity.
Encouraging female students to focus on subjects with more private sector demand, providing
s
pecial entrepreneurship programs, and increasing female representation in decision making
bodies would also allow Qatar to benefit more from this talent pool.13

30. Boosting Qatar’s economic complexity calls for (Text Figures 18 and 19):
• Fostering innovation. Qatar’s patent applications rose rapidly over the last decade, more so
than in its GCC peers. To promote innovation and support start-ups, a venture capital program
(“Fund of Funds”) is being established by the QIA. NDS3 aims to increase Qatar’s R&D funding
f
rom the current 0.7 percent of GDP to 1.5 percent, with the majority from the private sector.
More attention is needed to enhance Qatar’s R&D spending efficiency and quality. Further
improvement in intellectual property rights protection (e.g., in patent and trademark protection)
is also key.

• Promoting trade diversification. Progress in Qatar’s export diversification is limited, mainly in
services export (transportation and tourism). For a country with a small domestic market, export
diversification, especially in higher value-added goods and services, is particularly important. To
this end, Qatar should further reduce non-tariff barriers, facilitate intra-GCC trade, upgrade trade
infrastructure, liberalize services trade, promote free trade agreements and leverage new trade
corridors (Middle Corridor from China to Europe; India-Middle East-Europe Corridor).

• Attracting FDI and boosting domestic knowledge spillovers. FDI inflows to Qatar have
traditionally focused on the hydrocarbon sector, but more recently inflows to knowledge sectors
(e.g., ICT) rose. Further reducing entry barriers for foreign firms and promoting healthy
competition are crucial to attract FDI. Qatar’s increasing focus on PPPs and further intra-GCC
financial integration could also help boost FDI. Enhanced human capital and innovation,
including to strengthen SMEs’ access to technology via financing, could facilitate domestic
knowledge spillovers from FDI.

• Further improving business efficiency. Qatar performs well in competitiveness indicators,
including on the overall business efficiency. Looking ahead, Qatar could further ease access to
finance, especially for SMEs which represent a large share of domestic firms. Reforms to protect
l
egal rights of borrowers and lenders, simplify insolvency procedures to accelerate resolution
and improve recovery rate, strengthen creditor assessment tools, and proper use of fintech
w
ould ease SMEs’ financing constraints. Continued efforts to streamline business regulations
and p
rocedures, improve transparency and accountability, and further deepen public sector
digitalization would support the transition to private sector-led growth. As Qatar considers
p
rivatization of certain state assets to enhance efficiency and foster private sector participation,
it is crucial to ensure strong governance and transparency, preserve the state’s best interest, and
us
e the privatization proceeds productively.

31. Successful implementation of Qatar’s ambitious reform agenda hinges on proper
p
rioritization, inter-agency coordination, effective execution, and careful management of
policy spillovers. Many reform initiatives are in train to achieve NDS3 goals. They should be
properly sequenced to prioritize more impactful reforms and explore synergies and
c
omplementarities. Inter-agency coordination is critical to ensure policy consistency and maximize
implementation capacity. Incentives to various specialized economic zones and centers to promote
FDI and trade, as well as policy support to “diversification clusters,” should target well-identified
e
xternalities, market and coordination failures, or under-provision of public input—they are no
substitution for broad-based structural reforms. Diversification gains from economic zones and
priority sectors should be broadened to the wider economy by promoting stronger spillovers.
Periodic cost-benefit assessments will help rationalize incentives and keep them time-bound.
32. Qatar is well positioned to leverage
digitalization and AI (Text Figure 20). Qatar’s
digital infrastructure, quality and affordability are
comparable to those in advanced economies (AEs). 
The Digital Agenda 2030, launched in March 2024, 
sets further ambitions in enhancing digital 
innovation, expanding e-government services, 
developing digital skills, and refining regulatory 
frameworks. Qatar is also close to AEs in its AI 
readiness, and its labor market has a relatively 
large share of jobs that can benefit from AI rather 
than being replaced, making the country well-
positioned to reap AI-driven productivity gains 
with limited job displacement risks (Box II). 
Enhancing digital skills of the labor force, 
promoting digital/AI penetration in production, strengthening cybersecurity risk management and 
facilitating job transitions are critical to fully benefit from digitalization and AI while mitigating labor 
market risks. 
33. Qatar has advanced its climate agenda further. In early-2024, Qatar raised $2.5 billion in a
debut green deal under its new sovereign green financing framework. In June 2024, the QCB
l
aunched the ESG and Sustainability Strategy for the financial sector to strengthen the financial
system’s capacity in supporting national sustainability goals. The share of energy capacity from
renewables reached about 9 percent in 2023 against a target of 20 percent by 2030 (Text Figure 21).
The NDS3’s emphasis on improving energy and water use efficiency is welcome. A concerted effort
is needed to achieve Qatar’s climate goals, including to gradually phase out remaining energy
subsidies and reduce domestic energy price differentials from export prices, increase green
investment, promote climate financing, enhance interagency coordination, and upgrade the
regulatory framework.

Box 2. AI in Qatar: Opportunities and Potential Economic Impact1 
Qatar has been actively preparing for embracing AI. In 2019, Qatar released its first National AI Strategy, 
focusing on education, data access, employment, business, research, and ethics. The AI Committee, 
established in 2021, coordinates efforts from ministries, universities, and financial institutions. A $2.5 billion 
AI investment package was announced in May 2024. AI-related research has also surged. Overall, Qatar is 
close to AEs in its AI readiness (text chart).  
Increasing AI adoption in Qatar is expected to bring more benefits than risks to the labor market. 
Currently, about 37 percent of the labor force in Qatar is exposed to AI (18 ppts increase over a decade), 
comparable to the EM average but lower than the AE average (58 percent). Building on IMF (2023)2 staff 
analysis suggests that about 75 percent of the high AI exposure jobs in Qatar have high 
“complementarity”—workers in those jobs are more likely to benefit from AI-driven productivity gains than 
being replaced. Qatar’s labor market opportunity-to-risk ratio from AI exposure is significantly higher than 
EM or AE averages.

Authorities’ Views 
34.      The authorities concurred with staff’s call to accelerate structural reforms, and noted 
that a large number of initiatives and projects were underway guided by NDS3. The newly 
established National Planning Council highlighted its role in prioritizing reforms, ensuring inter-
agency coordination and monitoring progress. The authorities agreed with staff recommendation to 
focus reforms on boosting human capital and innovation, enhancing the business environment, 
attracting FDI and promoting exports. They agreed that Qatar was well placed to leverage AI for 
productivity gains, and highlighted Qatar’s comparative advantage in energy cost and reliability to 
attract data centers, around which an ecosystem could be built to enhance domestic value added. 
Box 2. AI in Qatar: Opportunities and Potential Economic Impact (concluded)
 
The private sector has played an important role in shifting Qatar’s labor market toward a more 
favorable position for AI adoption. Private sector employment has grown by around 27 percent over the 
last decade, but the number of technicians and professionals—two job categories with high AI exposure and 
complementarity—has increased by over 90 percent, significantly enhancing the country's potential to 
benefit from AI adoption. 
“Enabling clusters” identified in NDS3 are likely to harness AI-driven productivity gains. By matching 
the occupational composition of these clusters (IT & digital, financial services, and education) in Qatar with 
the AI exposure-complementarity matrix, staff finds that these sectors concentrate in the high AI exposure 
and complementarity quadrant. On the other hand, the “growth clusters” identified in NDS3—
manufacturing, logistics, and tourism—tend to have more limited AI exposure.  
Scenario analysis points to potential gains in labor productivity from AI penetration in Qatar. Staff 
analysis suggests that, under an optimistic scenario where successful reforms to enhance human capital, 
innovation and private sector growth allow a more rapid increase in the share of jobs exposed to AI and 
faster AI adoption (than under the baseline), labor productivity growth could be lifted by an average of 1 ppt 
annually (above the baseline) over the medium term.

The authorities stressed that they were on track to meet the 2030 climate targets guided by the 
National Environment and Climate Change Strategy and National Climate Change Action Plan.  
E. Enhancing D ata Adequacy
35. Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but gaps remain (Annex VII). The
authorities are fully committed to meeting the IMF standards under the Enhanced General Data
Dissemination System (e-GDDS). Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but gaps
remain in the coverage and granularity of fiscal and external statistics, especially for the International
Investment Position (including QIA positions), FDI and portfolio investment. The strong emphasis on
data in NDS3 is encouraging, and the NPC is working to enhance inter-agency coordination for data
c
ollection and dissemination. The IMF stands ready to support the authorities’ progress in data and
st
atistics through capacity building.
Authorities’ Views 
36. The authorities welcomed the IMF’s initiative to strengthen data adequacy and agreed
with staff assessment. They noted that the establishment of the national statistics center under the
NPC would enhance data collection and dissemination and expressed interest in collaborating with
the
 IMF, including through TA. The gaps in external sector statistics were well recognized, and the
NPC stressed that strong efforts were underway to enhance FDI data, which is also important for
monitoring and assessing progress in NDS3 initiatives.
STAFF APPRAISAL 
37. Qatar has a favorable economic outlook and continues to demonstrate resilience to
external shocks. Recent indicators suggest that the post-World Cup growth normalization has
bottomed out and the gradual rebound in economic activities is gaining momentum. The medium-
term outlook is more positive, driven by significant increases in LNG production and the anticipated
b
enefits from NDS3 implementation. By maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies and
a
ccelerating reform efforts, Qatar can further solidify its resilience to shocks and prosperity.
38. The authorities’ commitment to sustain fiscal discipline can be supported by
a
ccelerated fiscal reforms. Adopting a PIH-based medium-term fiscal anchor can help ensure
i
ntergenerational equity and guide a countercyclical fiscal policy. Accelerating revenue
di
versification including to introduce the VAT would enhance revenue resilience and reduce the tax
revenue gap. To support efficient NDS3 reform implementation and ensure fiscal sustainability, it is
i
mportant to enhance spending efficiency through rationalizing the wage bill and gradually phasing
out the remaining subsidies, and improve spending composition to facilitate the transition to private
sector-led growth. Gradually aligning domestic energy prices with export ones could generate
additional revenue and support Qatar’s climate goals. The ongoing efforts to strengthen fiscal
institutions pave the way to adopt a full-fledged MTFF with enhanced fiscal risk management.
=== PAGE 33 ===
QATAR 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 29 
39. Strong efforts to maintain financial stability and deepen domestic financial market
s
hould continue. Maintaining diligent supervision is important especially for banks with weaker
asset qualities. Formalizing the financial safety net would further enhance financial stability. The QCB
should continue to review its macroprudential policies and adjust as needed to mitigate potential
macro-financial risks. Guided by FSS3, efforts to develop domestic capital market should accelerate,
which would also help banks reduce their reliance on public sector deposits and exposure to short-
term foreign funding. Qatar’s excellent efforts in fighting financial crimes should continue.
40. The exchange rate peg continues to serve Qatar well. The QCB should continue to adjust
i
ts policy rates in line with the US Federal Reserve while improving its liquidity forecasting. Over
time, establishing a wider and more stable policy interest rate corridor, promoting a more active
interbank market, and allowing fully market-based bank lending interest rates would enhance
monetary policy transmission. Qatar’s external position in 2023 was assessed to be moderately
stronger than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies.
41. Qatar’s vision to build a more diversified and knowledge-based economy calls fo
r
e
nhancing human capital and boosting economic complexity. Attracting and retaining high-
skilled expatriate workers, enhancing the nationals’ talent and employment in the private sector, and
f
urther benefiting from the female talent will enhance human capital. Economic complexity can be
boosted by fostering innovation, promoting trade diversification, attracting FDI with domestic
knowledge spillovers, and further improving business efficiency. Successful implementation of
Qatar’s ambitious reform agenda hinges on proper prioritization, inter-agency coordination,
effective execution, and careful management of policy spillovers. Efforts to leverage digitalization
and AI will bring productivity gains, and climate actions should continue. Data provision is broadly
adequate for surveillance and the authorities are encouraged to close the remaining gaps.
42. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Qatar take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Annex I. Overview of Qatar’s Third National Development Strategy 
This Annex provides a brief overview of the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3), which sets 
the priorities to build a knowledge-based and more sustainable economy. It stresses the state’s role as 
an enabler of private sector-led growth, based on a candid assessment of the limitations and 
challenges associated with a state-driven growth model. 
1. Qatar’s Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) aims for a transformation 
toward a private sector-led, knowledge-based, and more sustainable economy (Annex Figure 
1-1). Issued in January 2024, NDS3 covers the last miles of Qatar’s National Vision (QNV) 2030. From 
NDS1 (2011-16), NDS2 (2018-22) to NDS3 (2024-30), Qatar’s diversification strategy has gradually 
transitioned from a public sector-driven, infrastructure-focused approach, to one that empowers the 
private sector to build a more dynamic and innovative economy (Table 1). NDS3 aims to leverage 
Qatar’s strengths built over the last decade, including large financial resources, enhanced human 
capital, and high-quality infrastructure. The strategy lays out a systematic approach for economic 
transformation, with ambitious targets set.  
2. NDS3 highlights Qatar’s progress made since the launch of the Qatar National Vision 
2030. Substantial strides have been made in economic, human, social, environmental, and 
institutional development. In particular, Qatar has achieved solid economic growth during 2008–23 
(average 5½ percent), with the share of non-hydrocarbon economy rising by more than 10 
percentage points (ppts) to 63 ppts. Qatar’s education and health systems, labor market including 
for expatriate workers, and government effectiveness have also witnessed significant improvements.  
3. NDS3 also recognizes candidly the limitations and key challenges in Qatar’s 
diversification journey. Qatar’s progress in economic diversification lags some other GCC 
countries, especially in fiscal revenue and exports. NDS3 acknowledges relatively low non-
hydrocarbon output growth in recent years with declining labor productivity, its costly diversification 
model driven largely by public sector spending with implications for fiscal sustainability, and 
incentives that hinder private sector development, entrepreneurship, and innovation. Skilled and 
highly skilled employment rose (including both nationals and expatriates) but the majority remains 
less skilled. NDS3 points out barriers to market entry and FDI, various regulatory impediments, an 
immature innovation ecosystem, and insufficient human capital as key challenges for further 
transformation. The global energy transition only compounds the need to accelerate economic 
diversification.  
4. NDS3 stresses that the state should become an “enabler” of more vibrant and 
sustainable private sector-driven growth. A wide range of reforms are envisaged to close 
remaining gaps in innovation, human capital, and the regulatory environment. NDS3 highlights the 
need to harmonize economic zones to help attract FDI, boost international trade including through 
additional trade agreements with key target markets, and Public-Private partnership (PPP) to 
facilitate private sector participation. It also identifies “diversification clusters” to build comparative 
advantages, setting ambitious targets both at the sectoral level and on macroeconomic outcomes.

5. In particular, NDS3 lays out seven strategic outcomes with numerical targets:  
• Growth model. A more sustainable growth model is envisaged, underpinned by Qatar’s 
stronger position in the global gas market and a focus on high productivity “diversification 
clusters” –– growth clusters (manufacturing, logistics and tourism), enabling clusters (IT & digital, 
financial and education) and resilience clusters (food and agriculture, health). Key 
macroeconomic targets include to achieve an average annual real GDP growth, both for total 
and non-hydrocarbon, of 4 percent (the past five-year-average was at 0.8 and 1.5 percent, 
respectively), create a top-10 global business environment, attract $100 billion FDI inflows 
(cumulatively over 2024–30), increase R&D spending to 1.5 percent of GDP (currently at 
0.7 percent of GDP) with 60 percent from the private sector, and improve labor productivity 
growth to 2 percent annually (the past five-year-average was close to zero).

• Fiscal policy. A more sustainable, shock-resistant medium-term fiscal framework is envisaged, 
supported by diversified revenues, efficient expenditures, and relatively low debt. Key 2030 
targets include to reach a fiscal surplus of 5½ percent of GDP (the past five-year-average was 
3 percent), maintain the current sovereign credit ratings of AA/Aa2 with stable outlook, and 
achieve manageable expenditure growth (below the non-hydrocarbon output growth rate). The 
government plans to reduce procyclicality of spending, implement program-based budgeting, 
and enhance debt management through frameworks including sovereign green financing. 
• Human capital. The government will promote STEM education and upskill the Qataris. 
Initiatives to attract high-skilled expatriate workers will include labor immigration reforms, 
upskilling programs with private sector participation, and new visa schemes for elite talent and 
entrepreneurs. The goal is for skilled labor force to exceed 46 percent of the total by 2030 
(currently at 28 percent), with 20 percent of the Qatari workforce in the private sector (currently 
at 17 percent). 
• Inclusiveness. Qatar aims at maintaining a high fertility rate (of 3 percent) and increase the 
economic participation of people with disabilities (to 30 percent by 2030). The government will 
launch marriage and family support programs, enhance maternity leave, and promote financial 
literacy. For vulnerable segments, initiatives include better identification, skill development, and 
expanded social services. Women's empowerment and volunteerism (targeting a 10 percent 
volunteer rate) will also be key focuses. 
• Health. Qatar targets a life expectancy of above 82 years and a 36 percent reduction in non-
communicable disease mortality by 2030. Key plans include healthcare infrastructure 
optimization, lifestyle programs, and advancing patient care. The government will enhance 
urban planning, cultural offerings, and public safety, aiming for fewer than 4.9 traffic deaths per 
100,000 population. Satisfaction scores for residents and visitors are targeted to exceed 88 
percent.  
• Climate and sustainability. Qatar aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent 
relative to the business-as-usual scenario by 2030 and expand renewable energy capacity to 
4 GW. The government will protect 30 percent of its land and marine areas, restore 30 percent of 
degraded natural habitats and reduce groundwater extraction by 70 percent, with per-capita 
water consumption below 310 liters per day. Plans include deploying carbon capture 
technologies, expanding biodiversity protection, improving water conservation, and fostering 
circular economy practices.  
• Government efficiency. Qatar targets to rank in the top 10 percent on the Government

Annex II. External Sector Assessment 
Overall Assessment: Qatar’s external position moderated in 2023 and was assessed to be moderately 
stronger than the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Tourism remained 
robust and fiscal prudence was maintained, but hydrocarbon prices normalized and exports declined. In 
2024H1, tourism continued to be strong, but hydrocarbon export volume remained weaker than historical 
levels, capping the current account surplus. In the medium term, hydrocarbon prices are projected to 
progressively decline but export volume is set to increase owing to a significant ramp up in LNG production in 
the pipeline. As domestic demand recovers, imports are expected to strengthen. On balance, the current 
account gap is expected to continue narrowing. 
Potential Policy Responses: Structural reforms to enhance productivity and competitiveness, as envisaged 
under NDS3 and the QNV 2030, would help raise private investment and reduce the saving-investment gap. 
Fiscal prudence should be preserved, revenue diversification toward non-hydrocarbon sources accelerated, and 
spending reoriented to support the reform agenda. These factors will reduce the current gap and help align the 
external position in the medium term.  
Foreign Assets and Liabilities: Position and Trajectory 
Background1. Central bank reserve accumulation was modest as the current account surplus narrowed and 
large asset acquisition abroad continued, including by the sovereign wealth fund (QIA). On the liabilities 
side, external debt declined somewhat in nominal terms due mainly to repayment of government debt but 
rose from 116 percent of GDP in 2022 to 123 percent of GDP in 2023 as nominal GDP shrank more. Central 
bank reserves stood at US$53.8 billion in November 2024, up US$2 billion from 2023.  
Assessment. On the asset side, QCB’s foreign reserves and sizeable QIA foreign assets together are 
estimated to have exceeded 200 percent of GDP in 2023—they will continue to be supported by the 
projected current account surpluses over the medium term. On the liabilities side, a moderate level of 
external public debt contributes to strong overall fiscal debt sustainability (Annex IV. Fiscal and Debt 
Sustainability Assessment). Commercial banks’ external liability remained broadly unchanged, leaving the 
net foreign liability relatively large.  
2023 (% GDP) NIIP: NA Gross Assets: 
NA QCB Res. Assets: 24.2 Gross Liab.: NA Debt Liab.: 123 
Current Account 
Background. The current account surplus fell from a decade high in 2022, by nearly 10 percentage points of 
GDP to 17 percent of GDP in 2023. Hydrocarbon prices normalized and in late-2023 hydrocarbon export 
volume declined amid the regional conflict. Tourism remained strong while both imports and remittance 
outflows declined (normalizing after the 2022 FIFA World Cup). In 2024H1, the current account surplus 
remained little changed from 2023H1 (US$20 billion). Hydrocarbon exports continued to edge lower and 
imports increased as growth started to rebound but tourism remained strong. The current account surplus is 
thus expected to abate somewhat to 16½ percent of GDP in 2024 and remain at around 15½ percent of 
GDP in the medium-term buoyed by the LNG production expansion in the North Field and relatively high, 
albeit gradually falling, hydrocarbon prices. 
=== PAGE 51 ===
QATAR 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 47 
Assessment. Staff assesses the 2023 external position to be moderately stronger than the level implied by 
fundamentals and desirable policies, based on the External Balance Assessment (EBA-Lite) regression model 
that yields a positive CA gap of 2.0 percent of GDP (text table). The REER regression model, which suggests 
a negative CA gap (–4.7 percent of GDP), was deemed less suitable for Qatar given its currency peg. Qatar’s 
significant reliance on hydrocarbons complicates the application of standard external assessment 
methodologies, given the large hydrocarbon price volatility in 2020–22 and more recent export volume 
volatility. Some of the volatility is captured by the adjustments for cyclical contributions and conflicts 
(0.9 percent and -1.1 percent of GDP, respectively). As the current account surplus is projected to moderate 
further in 2024, the CA gap is expected to narrow, aligning the external position more with the level implied 
by fundamentals and desirable policies.     
Real Exchange Rate 
Background. The Riyal has been pegged to the U.S. dollar 
at 3.64 since July 2001. Qatar’s nominal effective exchange 
rate (NEER) appreciated by 1 percent, similar to the US’s. 
Qatar’s real effective exchange rate (REER) weakened by 
1 percent in 2023 as the nation’s inflation was below its 
trading partners’. In 2024 through November, REER 
depreciated somewhat from the same period in 2023.   
Assessment. With large reliance on hydrocarbon exports 
priced in U.S. dollars and elastic supply of expatriate labor, 
the impact of REER performance on Qatar’s 
competitiveness is limited. Based on the estimated CA gap 
of 2.0 and an elasticity of 0.3, staff assesses REER as 
undervalued by 5.6 percent. The EBA-lite REER model suggests an overvaluation of 13.6 percent. 
Capital and Financial Accounts: Flows and Policy Measures 
Background. The capital and financial account weakened in 2023. The composition shifted notably. Net 
portfolio outflows rose by nearly 10 percentage points of GDP to 15 percent of GDP, driven by portfolio 
investments abroad (11 percent of GDP). In contrast, net other investment outflows declined by 
16 percentage points to 1 percent of GDP. Overseas investment declined and net reduction in liabilities 
mostly by commercial banks following the introduction of QCB measures, moderated. In 2024Q2, net 
portfolio outflows abated while net incurrence of other investment liabilities resumed.

Assessment. A lack of detailed information on the nature of financial flows complicates the analysis of 
Qatar’s financial account. The strong foreign asset position, including the QIA’s estimated sizable assets, 
limits risks and vulnerabilities related to capital flows. Declines in commercial banks’ foreign liabilities have 
reduced financial stability risks. 
FX Intervention and Reserves Level 
Background. The large current account surplus only 
translated into a moderate increase in central bank 
foreign reserves in 2023, by US$4 billion to reach 
US$51.5 billion, equivalent to 24 percent of GDP, 
7.8 months of prospective imports, 196 percent of 
short-term external debt, and an estimated 
59 percent of the IMF’s reserve adequacy metric 
(ARA, up from 52 percent in 2022)
2. Much of the 
current account surplus was estimated to have been 
invested by the QIA overseas. In 2024H1, foreign 
reserve accumulation ($1 billion) remained more 
modest than implied by the size of the current 
account surplus (US$20 billion).  
Assessment. Qatar’s “overall” FX reserve coverage was adequate in 2023. QCB foreign reserves are 
complemented by large foreign assets held by the QIA, estimated at 220 percent of GDP in 2023. Together, 
they account for about 600 percent of the ARA metric, significantly above the 100 percent adequacy 
benchmark. 
_____________________________________________________________________________ 
1The authorities face capacity constraints to provide comprehensive IIP data. 
2The ARA is a composite metric that measures the adequacy of precautionary reserves. It is based on the relative risk weights 
for each source of foreign exchange drain drawing on the 10th percentile of observed outflows from emerging market 
economies during exchange market pressure episodes. Reserves in the range of 100–150 percent of the composite metric 
are considered broadly adequate for precautionary purposes.

Annex III. Nowcasting of Non-hydrocarbon GDP Growth in Qatar 
This Annex applies nowcasting, which has been widely used for near-term growth projections, to 
Qatar’s real non-hydrocarbon output growth, with several innovations. Results fit historical data well 
and point to a gradual recovery from the post-World Cup growth trough. A few caveats related to the 
machine-learning approach for nowcasting are also discussed.  
1. Nowcasting generates real-time forecasts for key economic indicators where the 
official data may be unavailable or delayed by analyzing high-frequency macroeconomic 
indicators. For example, Qatar publishes GDP data with a lag of around 2-3 quarters, while policy 
makers and businesses may need a more timely 
assessment of the economy to inform policy and 
business decisions—nowcasting is an effective 
tool to fill the gap. This technique is particularly 
suitable where high-frequency indicators are 
abundant and published timely, as in the case of 
Qatar. Nowcasting models are also highly 
adaptable—they can be updated regularly with 
new data, ensuring that the estimates remain 
relevant and accurate amidst changing 
economic conditions. 
 
2. A nowcasting model for Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon economy is developed, based on 
previous IMF work (Barhoumi, Karim, et al. 2022, Akbal, Faruk, et al. 2023), following the steps 
below: 
• Select predictive variables. A wide range of economic and financial indicators are selected to 
capture domestic, regional and global conditions that could affect Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon 
economy. These variables are chosen based on criteria such as predictive power (i.e., suggested 
by the pairwise correlation between the predictive variable and Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon GDP), 
data availability, and minimal lag time. A balance is maintained between the number of 
predictors and the size of the training data (used to fit nowcasting models with historical trends) 
to avoid overfitting – a situation where the model is too "tailored" to the training data and fails 
to generalize to other situations, leading to inaccurate predictions. 
 
• Select nowcasting models. The selected time series data are processed through advanced 
machine learning algorithms (see below). A variety of models, including Support Vector 
Machines (SVMs), Random Forests, and Elastic Net, are trained by historical data. Each model's 
performance is evaluated using a range of metrics (e.g., out-of-sample root-mean-squared error 
(RMSE)), and the best-performing models are selected for further analysis. 
 
• Identify contributions of predictive variables. Shapley decomposition is applied to break 
down the contribution of each variable to the nowcast results. This method allows us to pinpoint 
Figure III.1. Qatar: Nowcasting Concept 
Source: IMF staff calculations.  

=== PAGE 54 ===
QATAR 
50 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
which variables have the most significant impact on the model's predictions. By identifying the 
key drivers, we can refine and iterate on the model to improve accuracy and reliability over time. 
Figure III. 2. Qatar: Project Overview 
Source: IMF staff. 
 
3. A few innovations have been introduced to Qatar’s nowcasting framework to optimize 
the variable and model selections:  
• A big data approach in variable selection is developed to enhance the coverage of potential 
predictors of economic growth and reduces the lag between real-world events and nowcasts. 
Unlike traditional methods that select variables based on specific economic theories, this 
approach collects a large number of variables including those that are unconventional in 
economic analysis, and evaluates their correlations with Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon GDP. 
Specifically, a Stata program is developed to scrape the Haver and CEIC databases, identifying 
relevant keywords in millions of data series. The keywords target data specific to Qatar and its 
key trading partners. The program chooses 1,300 Qatar-specific series and 1,200 series related 
to Qatar’s trading partners for further selection. For the 2,500 variables, pairwise correlations are 
run against Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon GDP. Those with the highest correlations (both positive 
and negative) are kept. Judgement based on economic theories and knowledge of the Qatari 
economy is then applied to ensure balanced sectoral coverage, narrowing the final pool to 
13 variables. Further refinements of variable selection can be done by conducting Shapley 
decomposition of nowcasting results to identify contributions from different predicative 
variables and iterate with alternative variables.  
• Machine learning (ML) models are applied to handle large and complex datasets. Unlike 
traditional methods such as statistical models and surveys, ML models allow for better 
integration of complex, non-linear relationships between economic variables that ARIMA models 
might miss due to their linear structure and reliance on smaller, time-series data. ML models can 
also adapt to changing patterns in data more efficiently than statistical models. They can learn 
from outliers, non-stationarity, and other irregularities, potentially yielding more accurate and 
timelier GDP nowcasts.

Source: IMF staff calculations. 
4. Qatar’s nowcasting results, which fit historical data well, point to a gradual recovery 
from the post-World Cup growth 
normalization. Various nowcasting models 
are compared based on their out-of-sample 
forecast performances (Figure 4). 
The Support Vector Machine (RBF) model, 
with the lowest RMSE, proves to be the most 
effective one for Qatar’s non-hydrocarbon 
GDP growth prediction. An average RMSE of 
1.4 across the best models indicates Qatar’s 
nowcasting framework performs comparably 
to those for regional peers (see Korniyenko et 
al, 2023). Figure 5 shows the overall fit of the 
model up to 2023Q4 and the nowcasting 
results up to 2024Q3, which point to a 
gradual recovery from the post-World Cup 
growth trough. Table 1 provides a list of variables used in the final Qatar model. Nine of the 
variables are Qatar-specific, covering the real sector (e.g., inflation and oil activities), external sector 
(e.g., export oil price to China), and financial sector (e.g., 3-month deposit rate and credit facilities).  
The remaining 4 series capture economic activities in Qatar’s key trading partners.

5. While a useful tool, the ML-based nowcasting framework comes with caveats. ML 
models are primarily focused on identifying statistical patterns in the dataset. The variable and 
model selections aim to maximize predictive power, and the results (including contributions from 
variables) should not be interpreted in the same way as in regression analysis, which is usually based 
on economic theories.

DSA Summary Assessment 
Commentary: Qatar is at a low overall risk of sovereign stress. Hydrocarbon prices are set to remain relatively high and commitmen  
to, and the recent track record of, fiscal discipline support low fiscal and debt risk. The large reserves of natural gas, cleaner than 
other browner fossil fuels, is likely to play a key role in a smoother energy transition, and strong financial buffers (including from the 
sovereign wealth fund, QIA) can provide support if downside risks materialize. The projected non-hydrocarbon primary balance 
(NHPB) is broadly consistent with the benchmark guided by the Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH) in the long term (see the main 
text of the Staff Report). The authorities are in the process of producing own actuarial studies on the sustainability of the pension 
system.  
Source: Fund staff. 
Note: The risk of sovereign stress is a broader concept than debt sustainability. Unsustainable debt can only be resolved through exceptional measures (such as debt 
restructuring). In contrast, a sovereign can face stress without its debt necessarily being unsustainable, and there can be various measures—that do not involve a debt 
restructuring—to remedy such a situation, such as fiscal adjustment and new financing. 
1/ The near-term assessment is not applicable in cases where there is a disbursing IMF arrangement. In surveillance-only cases or in cases with precautionary IMF 
arrangements, the near-term assessment is performed but not published. 
2/ A debt sustainability assessment is optional for surveillance-only cases and mandatory in cases where there is a Fund arrangement. The mechanical signal of the debt 
sustainability assessment is deleted before publication. In surveillance-only cases or cases with IMF arrangements with normal access, the qualifier indicating probability of 
sustainable debt (""with high probability"" or ""but not with high probability"") is deleted before publication.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 63 
Annex V. Risk Assessment Matrix1 
Source of Risk and Likelihood Expected Impact if Risk is Realized Policy Response 
Global Risks 
High Medium  
Intensification of regional conflict(s). 
Escalation or spread of the conflict in Gaza 
and Israel, Russia’s war in Ukraine, and/or 
other regional conflicts or terrorism disrupt 
trade (e.g., energy, food, tourism, supply 
chains), remittances, FDI and financial flows, 
and payment systems, and lead to refugee 
flows. 
The impact would depend on the nature of the 
event. The shock could translate into higher global 
hydrocarbon prices, but there is also the risk of LNG 
export disruption—the overall impact on Qatar is 
highly uncertain. Intensification of regional 
conflict(s) could also weaken investor confidence 
and disrupt supply chain, tourism, and capital flows.  
The policy response would depend on the 
nature of the shock. Qatar has fiscal space to 
respond to a negative shock. The central 
bank should provide adequate liquidity in the 
banking system if needed. Continue to 
closely monitor financial institutions. 
 
High High  
Commodity price volatility. Supply and 
demand fluctuations (e.g., due to conflicts, 
export restrictions, OPEC+ decisions, and 
green transition) cause recurrent 
commodity price volatility, external and 
fiscal pressures and food insecurity in 
EMDEs, cross-border spillovers, and social 
and economic instability.
 
Qatar’s ongoing LNG production expansion will 
raise the economy’s sensitivity to energy price 
volatility. Higher-than-projected energy prices could 
strengthen fiscal and external positions, and non-
hydrocarbon output growth as ample hydrocarbon 
liquidity and positive private sector confidence 
could boost consumption and investment. Pressures 
to increase public spending could rise. Lower oil 
prices would weaken the external and fiscal 
balances, and growth. 
The authorities should implement a medium-
term fiscal framework which helps insulate 
public spending from oil price volatility. 
Diversifying the revenue base toward more 
non-hydrocarbon sources would reduce 
revenue sensitivity to energy price volatility. 
Accelerate structural reforms to advance 
economic diversification.
 
Medium Medium  
Global growth downside surprise. Growth 
slowdown in major economies, including 
due to supply disruptions, tight monetary 
policy, rising corporate bankruptcies, or a 
deeper-than-envisaged real estate sector 
contraction, with adverse spillovers through 
trade and financial channels, triggering 
sudden stops in some EMDEs. (Low 
probability is assigned to surprise 
acceleration in global growth). 
 
Lower external demand reduces hydrocarbon export 
prices, weakening fiscal and external positions which 
are currently strong. Slower global growth would 
also weigh on domestic growth, affecting banking 
sector asset quality. Global financial market 
corrections may lead to capital outflows and 
increase financial stability risks, including due to 
banks’ still sizeable exposure to foreign funding. 
 
Qatar has fiscal space to respond to a major 
growth slowdown. Fiscal policy should be 
anchored in a medium-term framework to 
reduce the risk of procyclicality. Continue to 
closely monitor banking sector developments 
to maintain financial stability. Accelerate 
structural reforms to boost economic 
diversification and non-hydrocarbon 
potential output. 
 
Medium Low  
Monetary policy calibration. Amid 
elevated uncertainty and data surprises, 
monetary policy stances in major countries 
turn out to be too loose, hindering 
disinflation, or too tight for too long than 
warranted, stifling growth domestically and 
globally, and increasing capital flow and 
exchange rate volatility in EMDEs. 
Consistent with the exchange rate peg, monetary 
policy in Qatar would closely follow that of the U.S. 
As domestic inflationary pressure remains low and 
growth continues to normalize from the World Cup-
driven boom, the risk that a too loose monetary 
stance could de-anchor inflation expectations is 
limited. On the other hand, a monetary stance too 
tight for too long than warranted could negatively 
affect demand, but the ongoing public investment 
and spillovers from the North Field LNG expansion 
will support growth.
 
Maintain monetary policy and liquidity 
management that are consistent with the 
currency peg. Continue to closely monitor 
banking sector developments to ensure 
financial stability. If growth is negatively 
affected by unduly tight (imported) monetary 
policy stance, some fiscal space could be 
deployed to provide targeted support while 
maintaining broad fiscal prudence. 
 
Medium Low  
Systemic financial instability. High interest 
rates and risk premia, and sudden asset 
repricing amid economic slowdowns and 
policy uncertainty (including from elections) 
trigger market dislocations, with cross-
border spillovers and an adverse macro-
financial feedback loop putting weak banks 
and NBFIs under pressure. 
Tighter global financial conditions would increase 
debt service and financing costs, and increase the 
liquidity risk for domestic banks reliant on foreign 
funding as banks’ net foreign liabilities remain 
relatively high. Such risks are however mitigated by 
Qatar’s large financial buffers, favorable market 
access, high sovereign credit ratings, and banks’ 
reduced exposure to nonresident deposits.   
Maintain prudent financial sector policy and 
closely monitor risks and vulnerabilities 
related to financial institutions, including 
through stress tests and thematic inspections. 
Provide liquidity to the financial system if 
needed, compatible with the currency peg. 
 
 
1  The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path. The relative likelihood is the staff’s 
subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a 
probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the 
source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may 
interact and materialize jointly.

QATAR 
64 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
Source of Risk and Likelihood Expected Impact if Risk is Realized Policy Response 
Global Risks 
High Medium  
Deepening geoeconomic fragmentation. 
Broader conflicts, inward-oriented policies, 
and weakened international cooperation 
result in a less efficient configuration of 
trade and FDI, supply disruptions, 
protectionism, policy uncertainty, 
technological and payments systems 
fragmentation, rising shipping and input 
costs, financial instability, a fracturing of 
international monetary system, and lower 
growth. 
Supply disruptions and higher input costs would 
accelerate inflation. Lower FDI and trade would 
dampen output growth and the pace of economic 
diversification. The fiscal and external accounts 
would benefit if the price of and demand for the 
nation’s natural gas strengthen.
 
Accelerate fiscal and structural reforms to 
boost potential non-hydrocarbon output 
growth, economic diversification, and private 
investment. Provide targeted support to the 
most vulnerable against higher inflation. 
Maintain prudent financial sector policy to 
ensure financial stability. 
 
High Medium  
Cyberthreats. Cyberattacks on physical or 
digital infrastructure (including digital 
currency and crypto assets), technical 
failures, or misuse of AI technologies trigger 
financial and economic instability. 
As the nation continues to enhance its global 
visibility and digitalization, cyberthreats have 
reportedly increased significantly. Cyberattacks 
would, for instance, lead to financial losses for 
individuals and businesses, the theft of sensitive 
information, and disruptions in key operations 
(businesses, transportation, or power).
 
Qatar has expanded its capacity to contain 
cyberthreats by creating the National 
Cybersecurity Agency in 2021. A National 
Cybersecurity Strategy 2024-30 has been 
launched in September 2024 to further 
enhance legislation, coordinate with the ICT 
sector, and strike a balance between ensuring 
cybersecurity and promoting innovation. 
Effective implementation of the strategy, and 
continued close monitoring and supervision 
including of the banking and payment 
systems are key.
 
Medium High  
Climate change. Extreme climate events 
driven by rising temperatures cause loss of 
life, damage to infrastructure, food 
insecurity, supply disruptions, lower growth, 
and financial instability. A disorderly 
transition to net-zero emissions and 
regulatory uncertainty lead to stranded 
assets and low investment. 
Qatar’s ecosystem is highly vulnerable to climate 
shocks. Climate stressors have a significant impact 
on water, temperature, and sea level. With limited 
water resources and increasing temperatures, 
adaptation costs are likely to increase rapidly. 
Extreme climate events in partner countries could 
affect Qatar. A disorderly energy transition could 
affect Qatar’s hydrocarbon revenue and hence the 
fiscal and external positions.
 
In line with Qatar National Vision 2030, 
continue working on various initiatives, 
including renewable energy, green building 
practices, sustainable transportation, and 
education and awareness campaigns. The 
Climate Change Action Plan identifies a 
number of mitigation and adaptation 
measures across various sectors (healthcare, 
biodiversity, water management and 
infrastructure) to ensure the implementation 
the National Environment and Climate 
Change Strategy and the achievement of key 
goals including 25 percent reduction in GHG 
emissions by 2030. 
 
Domestic Risks 
Medium Medium  
Real estate market weakness. Property 
prices remain weak amid oversupply, 
negatively affecting the banking system and 
the broader economy.  
Bank asset quality could weaken, and the 
construction sector would come under pressure, 
potentially dampening credit and non-hydrocarbon 
output growth. On the other hand, banks’ exposure 
to the real estate market is well provisioned. Policy 
measures were also introduced in 2023 to monitor 
and mitigate risks associated with the real estate 
market.
 
Leverage the ongoing effort to step up 
surveillance of the property sector. Monitor 
risks to the banking sector closely and 
recognize NPLs promptly. Maintain strong 
banking sector capital buffers, liquidity and 
provisioning to mitigate the impact. 
Formalize financial safety net. Qatar has fiscal 
space to help contain threat to 
macroeconomic and financial stability. 
 
Medium Medium  
Uncertainty surrounding the 
implementation of the Third National 
Development Strategy. Risks are two 
sided. On the upside, implementation could 
be faster, more efficient, and better 
coordinated than expected. On the 
downside, insufficient coordination and 
implementation capacity could lead to 
resource misallocation and slower progress.  
Faster-than-expected implementation would boost 
medium-term growth more than envisaged. Slower-
than-expected implementation would result in 
weaker-than-envisaged output gains. Resource 
misallocation would also entail larger fiscal costs.  
Properly sequence reforms and enhance 
inter-agency coordination to ensure 
appropriate resource allocation and smooth 
implementation. Regularly monitor and 
assess progress relative to benchmarks, 
reassess risks, and recalibrate implementation 
plans as needed, leveraging the newly 
established National Planning Council.

Annex VI. Implementation of the 2023 Article IV Recommendations 
 
Recommendations Status 
Fiscal Policy 
The medium-term fiscal strategy should 
balance sustained fiscal prudence and 
transformation to a private sector-led 
economy.  
Broad fiscal prudence has been maintained and is expected to be 
upheld. The authorities plan to align spending with reform priorities in 
line with NDS3, including towards building climate resilience and 
human capital. 
Accelerate revenue diversification, 
including via VAT introduction and CIT 
broadening.  
Recognizing the importance of mobilizing non-hydrocarbon revenues, 
the authorities preferred to introduce the VAT and other revenue 
diversification measures when domestic/global growth are more robust. 
Preparation for the implementation of the global minimum CIT is 
underway—its introduction is expected to be at the beginning of 2025.   
Rationalize wage bill and continue 
subsidy reforms. 
Efforts are ongoing to introduce program-based budgeting, and the 
expenditure review program to enhance efficiency is underway.  
Establish a well-designed medium-term 
fiscal framework and enhance 
transparency. 
Qatar’s updated medium-term budget covers a 5-year period for the 
first time to support NDS3 implementation.  
Monetary and Financial Sector Policy  
Strengthen liquidity forecasting and 
management. 
The QCB has continued to improve liquidity management through T-bill 
issuance. A recent IMF technical assistance provided a series of 
recommendations which the QCB is considering. 
Contain banks' exposure to foreign 
liabilities. 
A series of QCB measures have helped reduce banks’ short-term foreign 
asset-liability mismatches. A comprehensive Third Financial Sector 
Strategy was published, with plans to deepen domestic financial market 
which would help boost banks’ domestic funding.  
Continue strengthening efforts to 
enhance banking sector resilience. 
Financial safety net (deposit insurance, recover/resolution framework) is 
being enhanced with IMF technical assistance. Measures to limit risks 
from the real estate sector have been introduced.  
Carefully balance opportunities and 
risks around fintech and green financing 
initiatives with adequate regulations.  
A number of related areas are articulated in the Third Financial Sector 
Strategy. Fintech sandboxes provide a controlled environment. The 
digital asset framework establishes a legal and regulatory foundation.  
Implement the FATF action plan in a 
decisive and coordinated manner. 
The authorities have submitted an action plan to implement FATF 
recommendations. A recent IMF diagnostic mission identified TA needs 
and initiated a 2-year work program to strengthen the effectiveness of 
the AML/CFT framework. 
Structural Reforms and Statistics 
Focus further reforms on productivity, 
business environment, digitalization, 
and climate actions. 
Reforms are being intensified guided by the Third National 
Development Strategy (NDS3) released in January 2024, which provides 
an ambitious reform agenda to enhance human capital, productivity, 
business environment, and climate resilience.  
Enhance macroeconomic statistics by 
improving data quality, coverage, and 
timeliness, and by strengthening the 
institutional framework for statistics. 
The National Planning Council (NPC) took over the former Planning and 
Statistics Authority (PSA) in May 2024. The National Statistics Center is 
established under NPC to strengthen statistics. Comprehensive data 
coverage on the external financial account and the International 
Investment Position remains a challenge, highlighted by Qatar's 
absence from surveys on CPIS and CDIS.

Annex VII. Data Issues 
Table VII. 1. Qatar: Data Adequacy Assessment for Surveillance 
Rationale for staff assessment. Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance but with shortcomings. Data frequency, timeliness and coverage should be improved. 
National accounts. Data sources used to compile quarterly estimates of GDP at current and constant prices need to be broadened to enhance accuracy. GDP by 
expenditure needs to be more up to date–by component annual data lag the headline (in current prices) or are available only up to 2018 (in constant prices). For the latter, 
the quarterly data should also provide a breakdown (only the headline number is produced). Timeliness was an issue also for GDP by activity data (2023Q4 GDP data were 
released in early-September 2024. 2024Q1–Q2 GDP data were released in early-December 2024 and 2024Q3 GDP data at end-December 2024).  
Prices. Monthly Consumer and Producer Price Indices (CPI, PPI), and real estate price data are published timely. CPI weights need to be updated more frequently. The 
Ministry of Justice publishes Weekly Newsletter with daily property transaction data by type which can benefit from greater consistency to better inform surveillance.  
Government finance. The authorities are implementing the Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS) which enables compilation of accrual fiscal 
accounts. An IMF Technical Assistance (TA) mission in 2019 supported transition to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014. Transparency was enhanced by the 
publication of annual budget documents and quarterly budget performance reports for the central government with headline budget and debt numbers––the reports 
could include more line items and quarterly debt numbers. The prospectus for sovereign euro bond issuance includes detailed information on revenue and expenditure line 
items, and external bonds, but publication is infrequent. For the 2023 budget, a press release was published and, instead of the regular budget statement, the Minister 
provided relevant information at the press conference. The format of the 2024 budget statement was similar to the 2023 budget press release. The coverage of financial 
operations should be broadened to the general government including the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA).  
External sector. The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) reports quarterly balance of payments data timely, following the fifth edition of the balance of payments manual (BPM5). 
The financial account has been developed and coverage improved for major public corporations, the Qatar Financial Center Authority, and the Qatar Stock Exchange. 
However, financial account data are aggregated. The authorities need to improve coordination to enhance the coverage of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flow data (which 
deviate significantly from FDI commitment data). A 2017 TA mission helped develop a quarterly survey for nonfinancial sector data aimed at producing a quarterly 
International Investment Position (IIP) statement. However, following the TA the authorities have continued to face capacity constraints in providing comprehensive IIP data 
to the IMF. More work is needed to ensure comprehensive data coverage, collection, and granularity—efforts should strengthen to allow Qatar's participation in key 
surveys like the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) and the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS).  
Monetary and financial sectors. The QCB submits the monetary and financial statistics (MFS) for the central bank and other depository corporations based on the 
Standardized Report Forms (SRFs). The MFS data are published in the International Financial Statistics on a timely basis. Qatar also reports data on some key series and 
indicators of the Financial Access Survey (FAS), including mobile money and the two indicators of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, but does not report data by 
gender. The QCB reports the Financial Soundness Indicators as part of the National Summary Data Page, but does not submit to the IMF, and 4 indicators are missing 
relative to the IMF’s list of Core Financial Soundness indicators. 
Changes since the last Article IV consultation. The Planning and Statics Authority was replaced by a newly established National Planning Council to strengthen reform 
implementation stipulated in the Third National Development Strategy, including to improve statistics. The statistics authority is in the process of producing new supply 
and use tables to improve the consistency of GDP estimates. A household survey is being finalized, which will be used to update CPI weights. The domestic “FDI ecosystem” 
has been fully mapped to identify additional sources of input data including business registration platforms (i.e., QFC, QSTP, QFZA, Media city) which will increase survey 
frame from current 130+ entities to 2000+ entities. 
Corrective actions and capacity development priorities. Enhance awareness across government entities of the data gaps and international best practices. Implement 
recommendations made by the above-mentioned TAs. Encourage the authorities to seek the Institute for Capacity Development (ICD) training, additional Statistics 
Departments (STA) TAs, and participate in the workshop on the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) to be organized by the newly established Riyadh Regional 
Office. Urge the National Planning Council and National Statistics Center to coordinate efforts across relevant government entities on statistics including consolidation of 
scattered data, submission to the IMF, and broader publication.  
Use of data and/or estimates different from official statistics in the Article IV consultation. IIP data are unavailable, including QIA’s assets under management. Staff 
rely on different data sources as needed––it estimates external debt data (for non-bank private sector and public sector debt outside of the central government), uses 
alternative data sources for FDI, and relies on commercially available bank-level data. 
Other data gaps. A more granular forward-looking calendar of key data releases would aid surveillance and enhance transparency. By maturity assets and liabilities data 
and by sector non-performing loans (NPLs) data will enhance the assessment of banking sector risks for surveillance. Data on enterprises, particularly small and medium-
sized enterprises (SMEs), and on climate change adaptation and mitigation would help inform surveillance.

Statement by Mohamed Maait, Executive Director for Qatar, and Mira Merhi, 
 Advisor to Executive Director 
January 27, 2025 
 
On behalf of the Qatari authorities, we would like to extend our sincere gratitude to the Staff mission team for the 
constructive discussions during the recent Article IV consultation. 
Economic Developments and Outlook 
Underpinned by its long-term strategic diversification plan “the Qatar National Vision 2030”, the Qatar economic 
transformation is thriving, and substantial strides have been made in economic, human, social, environmental, and 
institutional development. After a very strong economic performance in 2022, boosted by the successful hosting of 
the 2022 FIFA World Cup, output growth has normalized in 2023 and 2024, with recent signs of economic activities 
strengthening at the end of 2024, notably in the tourism s ector. Qatar's inflation has been generally declining 
throughout 2023 and 2024. The medium-term outlook is positive, bolstered by massive LNG production expansion 
and by reform efforts which are expected to intensify under the upcoming Third National Development Strategy as 
well as under the Third Financial Sector Strategy (3FSS) which is also expected to provide impetus for a sustainable 
growth.  Qatar’s strong fundamentals and significant policy buffers would help mitigate any negative impact in case 
downside risks materialize. 
Fiscal Policy 
The State of Qatar’s low public debt, significant fiscal and external buffers, and the longer-term benefits and returns 
of the authorities’ investment plans for future generation are remarkable. The authorities continue to be  fully 
committed to a prudent fiscal policy that aim to optimize the use of Qatar’s resources by improving spending 
efficiency and mobilizing non -oil revenue s, all whilst promoting sustainable growth and preserving 
intergenerational equity. The 2024 budget was focused on allocating resources for the third National Development 
Strategy (NDS3) and supporting efforts to diversify the economy. The general budget continues to focus on 
achieving the goals of Qatar National Vision 2030 related to the development of human capital by focusing on the 
health and education sectors – with the allocations for the two sectors constitut ing 20% of the total budget - in 
addition to the goals related to diversifying the local economy and enhancing its competitiveness. 
The authorities are committed to a sustainable, shock -resistant medium -term fiscal framework  supported by 
diversified revenues, efficient expenditures, and relatively low debt. Key 2030 targets include to reach a fiscal 
surplus of 5½ percent of GDP (way above the past five-year-average of 3 percent), maintain the current sovereign 
credit ratings of AA/Aa2 with stable outlook, and achieve manageable expenditure growth. The government plans 
to reduce procyclicality of spending, implement program-based budgeting, and enhance debt management through 
frameworks including sovereign green financing. The authorities intend to continue addressing underlying spending 
inefficiencies and diversify fiscal revenues notably through implementing the corporate income tax Pillar II in line 
with the global timeline. The 2025 budget envisages broadly prudent spending plans and aims for a medium -term 
expenditure-based fiscal consolidation. The authorities have made good progress in expanding program -based 
budgeting to eventually cover all sectors by the end of 2025 and expect that the ongoing expenditure review would 
generate savings in the medium term. Moreover, the authorities plan to enhance their macroeconomic projections 
to support the medium -term budget update. The authorities view the fiscal risks from ongoing PPPs, mainly on 
operating and maintaining existing infrastructure, to be minimal. 
 
=== PAGE 77 ===
Monetary and Financial Sector Policies 
The Central Bank of Qatar  (QCB) continues to skillfully manage monetary and financial policies, preserving 
macroeconomic and financial stability and promoting sustainable growth. The authorities agree with staff’s 
assessment that the exchange rate peg continues to serve the Qatari  economy well. They appreciated the IMF 
technical Assistance on liquidity management and plan to progressively implement its recommendations. The QCB 
aims to further improve the effectiveness of monetary policy operational framework as a medium-term objective. 
Qatar’s banking sector is healthy, with strong capital buffers, sound liquidity and stable profitability. Furthermore, 
QCB maintains a robust regulatory framework and conducts effective supervision to ensure the health of the sector 
and to preempt any potential risks to financial stability. The QCB is committed to regular risk reassessment and the 
newly introduced risk-based supervision strengthened the assessment of emerging risks and early action. Banks are 
well prepared to manage legacy real estate sector weaknesses and the recent macroprudential measures were 
effectively implemented to address potential risks. The micro and macroprudential measures, including the counter-
cyclical capital buffer, are  periodically reviewed, and would be dynamically adjusted to manage emerging risks. 
Moving forward, developments in Qatar’s financial sector will be further supported by the Third Financial Sector 
Strategy (3FSS)  covering the period 2023 -2030. The strategy will be focusing on  governance and regulatory 
oversight; Islamic finance; digital innovation and advanced technologies; ESG and sustainability; and talent and 
capabilities, with the aim to create vibrant financial and capital markets that lead the region in innovation, efficiency, 
and investor protection. “Based on a four-pillar approach - banking, insurance, digital finance, and capital markets 
- the Strategy provides a roadmap for the financial sector in Qatar to unlock its full potential in line with Qatar 
National Vision (QNV) 2030. 
Qatar has made excellent progress in fighting financial crimes, as acknowledged by the 2023 AML/CFT mutual 
evaluation report by FATF  which highlighted the strength in preventing financial crimes and law enforcement 
through improved risk assessment  capacity and clearer policy priorities. The QCB has also b anned financial 
institutions to use crypto assets. The authorities remain firmly committed to strengthening the AML/CFT framework 
in alignment with global standards, with a focus on risk- based supervision a nd effective enforcement to uphold 
financial integrity and resilience. 
Structural Reforms 
The Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) 2024-2030 marks the final phase of the Qatar National Vision 
2030. Since launching the National Vision in 2008, Qatar has made significant strides by leveraging energy sector 
revenues to build world -class infrastructure and institutions.  As a result, Qatar’s nonhydrocarbon economy has 
grown to account for about two- thirds of the total output , which underscores Qatar’s commitment to long -term 
economic diversification. 
The NDS3 , launched in January 2024,  aims to achiev e sustainable economic growth, e stablish a sustainable 
medium-term general budget framework with healthy levels of debt , provide a high standard of living to Qataris 
and position Qatar as a global destination. The strategy  also aims at boosting human capital and innovation, 
enhancing the business environment, attracting FDI and promoting exports. The establishment of the National 
Planning Council will have a significant role in prioritizing reforms, ensuring inter -agency coordination, and 
monitoring progress. 
The authorities have recently launched the Qatar National Manufacturing Strategy for 2024- 2030 aiming to drive 
sustainable economic development, diversify key economic sectors, boost private sector  participation and 
contributions, advance manufacturing capabilities and strengthen Qatar’s economic competitiveness in regional and 
global markets, in line with the Qatar National Vision 2030.  Additionally, Qatar is targeting USD 100 billion in 
foreign direct investment by 2030, while creating an investment clima te that will establish Qatar as a leading 
=== PAGE 78 ===
innovation hub and preferred investment destination, both regionally and globally. Moreover, Qatar is prioritizing 
the information technology sector, and is well placed to leverage AI for productivity gain and has a comparative 
advantage in energy cost and reliability to attract data centers. The recent launch of the National Health Strategy 
2024-2030 will also further reinforce the goals of NDS3. 
The authorities are on track to meet their 2030 climate targets. Furthermore , the Ministry of Environment and 
Climate Change has launched its 2024 – 2030 Strategy aiming to support environmental sustainability, enhance
